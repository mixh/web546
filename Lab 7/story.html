            These are more thoughts then a story, i have not watched the matrix or any similar movie in the last 10 years but things have really started to feel lifeless these days, like it didnt use to happen before.

            The question always pops in the mind does anything matter, why are people so interested in news politics and celebrities when in the end of day nothing about this matters. It all feels like a distraction with everyone seems to be running towards the most unimportant things.

            The thing is sometimes it looks like people see only till the goal and not what after. Its like winning a sporting event, yeah you won it now what its just boring but no one has anyother solution.

            But it also makes sense that people believe in somethings as it shakes the foundation of everything once you stop to believe. also what do you believe in? See yah!
